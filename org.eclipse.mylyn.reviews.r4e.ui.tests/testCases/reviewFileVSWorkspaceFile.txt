//Test cases for the add anomaly from the workspace file which is 
not in the review yet (Sprint Bug 31)

//Setup
- Create a review
- Create review item which has a different version than the workspace
Note: We can use SVN, GIT and ClearCase file 
Result: The file will have the ">" in front of the file meaning the 
   file is different than the one in the workspace

//Test1 Create a review item from the workspace file and select Cancel
- Open the file under review from the package explorer (The same file name, but different version)
- Select some lines in the code
- Create an anomaly from the selected lines
Result: A pop up saying the file is different from the review file 
	It displays both file and version
	Select "cancel"  ==> Processing to create an anomaly stops there
	
//Test2 Create a review item from the workspace file and select Continue
- Open the file under review from the package explorer (The same file name, but different version)
- Select some lines in the code
- Create an anomaly from the selected lines
Result: A pop up saying the file is different from the review file 
	It displays both file and version
	Select "Continue"  ==> Processing to create an anomaly open 
	the dialogue to enter the data referring to an anomaly.
	
//Test3 Create a review item from the review  file 
- Open the file under review from the review navigator view
- Select some lines in the code
- Create an anomaly from the selected lines
