		<h2 id="Working_with_the_Navigator_View">Working with the Navigator View</h2>
		<p>The R4E Navigator View is the main component of R4E. It shows all the information that is available to the user and it is also the place where most user commands are available. The Review Navigator information is organized in a hierarchical tree structure and is presented in a Navigator panel. Commands are available in the view toolbar and in context menus that appear when right-clicking the navigator elements. </p>
		<p>

		<h3 id="Disabling_and_Restoring_Elements">Disabling and Restoring Elements</h3>
		<p>When Review Navigator elements are not relevant anymore (e.g. completed reviews), they can be removed from the view by using the ''Disable ''command from the element's context menu. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/DisableElement.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Disabled elements data is kept, but they will not appear in the navigator view anymore. Take note that currently it is not possible to completely remove references to an element once it is created. </p>
		<p>To see disabled elements in the Navigator view, go to the R4E Preferences Filter Tab and select the 
			<i>Show Disabled Elements</i> checkbox and apply the preferences. The disabled elements will show in the Navigator grayed out and with the little disabled decorator icon 
			<img border="0" src="images/Dsbldovr_tsk.gif"/> 
		</p>
		<p>Ideally, disabled elements should never be shown, but there could be a need to restore mistakenly disabled elements. To do so, select the ''Restore ''command from the disabled element context menu </p>

			<i>Open Element</i> command, or simply by double-clicking on it. &nbsp;Closing unused Review Groups make navigation easier and free up memory and resources, so the Groups should be closed when they are unused. 
		</p>
		<p>Likewise, reviews can also be open and closed using the same mecanism. The only difference is that only one review (called the Active Review) can be open at any given time. Opening another Review closes the currently open one. </p>
		<p>Take note that Review Groups and Reviews are automatically open after they are first created. </p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Adding_Participants_to_a_Review">Adding Participants to a Review</h3>

		<h3 id="Creating_a_Review_Item">Creating a Review Item</h3>
		<p>In R4E, Review Items are a collection of one or more files, or parts of files, that are to be reviewed. There are two types of Review Items that exist: Commit Review Items and Resource Review Items. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Creating_a_Resource_Review_Item">Creating a Resource Review Item</h4>
		<p>This item type is created by manually selecting a workspace resource (i.e. File) or a portion of a resource (i.e. line ranges within a given file). </p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create Resource review items for a whole file, right-click a File on a Package Explorer, Navigator or Project View and select the 
				<i>Add Review Item</i> command from the R4E context menu.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AddResourceReviewItemFile.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To create Resource review items for a portion of a file, right click a line range selection in an editor or compare editor, or on an element of the outline view and select the 
				<i>Add Review Item</i> command from the R4E context menu.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AddResourceReviewItemRange.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Once a Resource Review Item is created, it will be shown in the Review Navigator. If you expand the Review Item, you will see the child elements: The file on which the Review Item is applied and the line range selection that is part of the item. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ResourceReviewItem.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Creating_a_Commit_Review_Item">Creating a Commit Review Item</h4>
		<p>This item type is created by selecting files that were committed to a Version Control System repository. Currently, the only Version Control System supported is Git. </p>
		<p>To create a Commit Review Item, right click on a project attached to the Egit team provider (see Project Configuration) and select the 
			<i>Find Review Items</i> command from the R4E Context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/FindReviewItems.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This will show the Version Control System Commit Dialog (Here shown for the Git connector). </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/FindReviewItemsDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Use the 
			<i>Available Commits</i> combo box to browse through all available commits and select one. For the selected commit, the commit information and affected files appear in the Commit Information and Committed Components sections respectively. 
		</p>
		<p>Once a Commit Review Item is created, it will be shown in the Review Navigator. If you expand the Review Item, you will see the child elements: The file on which the Review Item is applied and, optionally if the option is selected in the preferences, the line ranges for the Deltas (or differences between the committed file and its direct ancestor) that are part of the Item. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/CommitReviewItem.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>The icons for the files that are new and were added in the commit will be shown decorated with a little 
			<img border="0" src="images/Addovr_tsk.png"/> icon The icons for the files that were removed in the commit will be shown decorated with a little 
			<img border="0" src="images/Removr_tsk.png"/> icon Files in the commit that are out of sync i.e. for which the version to review and the version present in the users workspace differ will be shown with the &gt; sign prepended to the filename. Such files can be reviewed, but to use the full navigatability provided by the editors, it is stongly recommended that the files be in sync with the workspace whenever possible. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_an_Anomaly">Creating an Anomaly</h3>
		<p>R4E Anomalies are raised by reviewers to flag problems or add comments on specific parts of the contents as part of the review process. </p>
		<p>Anomalies are added in a similar way Resource Review Items are, either from a selected Resource or from a portion/range of a resource, by selecting the 
			<i>Add Anomaly</i> command from the R4E context menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Anomalies that are directly tied to a specific selection/delta range can also be created by selecting the 
			<i>Add Linked Anomaly</i> command from the context menu of the affected selection/delta in the Review Navigation View 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewLinkedAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Anomalies can also be created at the review level. This is useful to flag problems that are not specifically tied to a given file or file part. To do this, use the 
			<i>Add Anomaly</i> Command from the context menu of the Global Anomalies element in the Review Navigator view. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewGlobalAnomaly.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the New Anomaly dialog. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewAnomalyDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the Anomaly Title and Description in the appropriate text fields. </li>
			<li>Under the Extra Parameters section, if Rule Sets are associated to the parent Review Group, the Rule Sets hierarchy will be shown and, optionally, a design rule can be selected and applied to this anomaly. This will set the Anomaly values with the selected rule values.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_Comments_on_an_existing_Anomaly">Creating Comments on an existing Anomaly</h3>
		<p>It is possible to add comments to an existing anomaly. This could be useful in discussing the anomaly or for tracking purposes. To create a Comment, use the 
			<i>Add Comment</i> command on the context menu on the selected Anomaly. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewComment.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>This opens the New Comment dialog, where the comment can be added. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewCommentDialog.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Importing_Postponed_Anomalies">Importing Postponed Anomalies</h3>
		<p>Postponed Anomalies are Anomalies that were written in previous Informal/Formal Reviews, but were not handled then and were instead set to 
			<i>POSTPONED</i> state.  If the current Review include files on which these anomalies were written, whether it is the same or a different version of a file, it is possible to import them in the currrent review so that they can be addressed.  Currently, only Postponed Anomalies that belong to Reviews under the same Review Group can be imported.  Also, take note that Global Anomalies cannot be imported.
		</p>
		<p>To import Postponed Anomalies, just select the current Review in the Navigator View and use the context menu:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ImportAnomalies.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>R4E will scan all Reviews under the current Review Group and will copy all Anomalies in 
			<i>POSTPONED</i> state that were written on files also included in the current Review.  Once the command is done, the imported elements will appear on their own container element under the Review element in the Review Navigator tree.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ImportAnomaliesView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>From then on, Postponed anomalies behave like any other Anomaly and can be handled in the same way.  When a Postponed Anomaly is modified, the changes will also be reflected in the original Anomaly (i.e. the one filed in the previous Review).  Likewise, any changes that are done by other users on the original Anomaly can be seen in the current review by refreshing the imported Anomalies, by re-issuing the Import command.  Take note that Postponed Anomalies that have their state changed from POSTPONED will be disabled.  If they are set back to Postponed, they will be restored as Postponed elements.</p>
		<h2 id="Handling_Design_Rules">Handling Design Rules</h2>
		<h3 id="Creating_a_Rule_Set">Creating a Rule Set</h3>
		<p>R4E support the use of Design Rules, to help reviewers enforce consistent design conventions and rules. A Rule Set is a container that includes multiple related Rule. Rule Sets are independently defined and can be shared among multiple Review Groups. Take note that the use of Design Rules is completely optional. </p>
		<p>To create a new Rule Set, select the New Group icon in the Review Navigator Toolbar. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NewRuleSet.png"/>

		<p>This section is only available for the inspection record. The list of anomalies raised during the review with the following information:
			File Name, line range, tile of the anomaly, class, ranking and the due date.</p>

		<h3 id="Performing_Basic_Reviews">Performing Basic Reviews</h3>
		<p>In R4E, basic reviews are the simplest form of reviews available. Basic reviews are stateless and the anomalies that are raised are also stateless. This means the the participants must track progress of the Review and of the raised Anomaly externally. </p>
		<p>Typically, the workflow of a basic review will go as follows: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Review is created </li>
			<li>Review Items are added, either by manually selecting reources or by automatically selecting files committed using the Find Review Items commmand on the target project </li>
			<li>Organizer/Lead notifies reviewers that the items are ready for review. his can be done externally or by using the Email notification functionality provided by R4E </li>
			<li>Reviewers review the items and raise anomalies as they encounter them. </li>
			<li>At any time there could be communication between the reviewers and the authors of the code under review. Since there is no anomaly state tracking, they will have to agree on how to handle the anomalies raised. </li>
			<li>Once all the reviewers are done and the anomalies are fixed, the review can be set as completed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Performing_Informal_Reviews">Performing Informal Reviews</h3>
		<p>Informal Review workflow is pretty much the same as the Basic Review workflow, so the steps described above still apply. However, the main difference is the fact that anomalies are now stateful and they need to be addressed/resolved before the review can be closed. </p>
		<p>The state diagram for the anomaly workflow is as follows: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/InformalAnomalyStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned: This is the state set when the anomalies are created. This is the only non-terminal state </li>
			<li>Deferred: The Anomaly will is valid but will not be fixed now, but at a later time </li>
			<li>Duplicated: The Anomaly is a duplicate of another one </li>
			<li>Rejected: The Anomaly is invalid and will not be fixed </li>
			<li>Fixed: The Anomaly is valid and was fixed. This is normally a terminal state, unless the Revew Exit Decision is set to Accepted with Follow-up, in which case the Verified state is the terminal one. </li>
			<li>Verified: The Anomaly was fixed and verified by the participant that raised it. This state is normally optional, but all Anomalies that are fixed should be subsequently set to verified is the Review Exit Decision is set to Accepted with Follow-up.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Once all the Anomalies are in a terminal state, the review can then be closed as it is done the a Basic Review. </p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Performing_Formal_Reviews">Performing Formal Reviews</h3>
		<p>Formal Review follow the IEEE 1028-1997 standard. They are stateful and divided into Review Phases. As in Informal Reviews, anomalies created are also stateful. </p>
		<p>The state diagram for Formal review workflow is as follows: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/FormalReviewStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Planning_Phase_2">Planning Phase</h4>
		<p>The Planning phase is the active phase when the review is initially created. In this phase, the Review Organizer and/or Lead adds the contents that is to be reviewed, either manually or by selecting items from the Version Control System and adds participant that will be part of the review. At the nend of this phase, a notification is sent to the participant that the items are ready to be reviewed, and an invitation to a decision meeting set-up by the Organizer/Lead. Once this phase is completed, it is impossible to go back to it. </p>
		<h4 id="Preparation_Phase_2">Preparation Phase</h4>
		<p>The Preparation phase is the phase where participants review the items included in the review and potentially raise anomalies. Once all reviewers have completed their tasks (and notified the Organozer/Lead), then the review can progress to the next phase. </p>
		<h4 id="Decision_Phase_2">Decision Phase</h4>
		<p>The Decision phase is where all the anomalies that were logged are analyzed and a decision is made on each of them on how to handle them. Potential outcomes include fixing the problem flagged by the anomaly, deferring it, or rejecting it if it is not valid. Once all the Anomalies are examined, a decision can be taken on how to close the review. The possible outcomes for the review at this stage is that it could be rejected and more reviewing/rework is necessary, it could be accepted as is, or it could be conditionnaly accepted, provided that the outstanding anomalies are fixed. </p>
		<h4 id="Rework_Phase_2">Rework Phase</h4>
		<p>The Rework phase is an optional phase, only used when a review is conditionally accepted, in which valid anomalies are fixed. Once the fixed are included, the anomalies will need to be re-checked to verify that the fixes are acceptable. When all the fixes are verified, the Review can be completed. </p>
		<h4 id="Other_Considerations">Other Considerations</h4>
		<p>Take note that there is a slight difference between the anomaly states in Informal Reviews and the ones used in Formal Reviews, as it can be seen below: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/FormalAnomalyStates.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>A new Anomaly in a Formal Review is set to 
			<i>CREATED ''by default. During the decision phase, it could be set to the same values as in Informal Reviews, and it can also be set to ''ACCEPTED</i>, which means that the anomaly is deemed valid and will be handled and fixed. There is no ''ASSIGNED ''state for Anomalies in Formal Reviews. The rest of the anomaly flow is essentially the same as with Informal Reviews.
